Contours are defined as the line joining all the points along the boundary of an image that are having the same intensity.
OpenCV has _findContour()_ function that helps in extracting the contours from the image. It works best on binary images, so we should first apply thresholding techniques, Sobel edges, etc.
The function returns a Python list of all the contours in the image. Each individual contour is a Numpy array of (x, y) coordinates of boundary points of the object.

``` python
import numpy as np
import cv2

img = cv2.imread('baseball.png')      #reading the image
imgray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)    # coverting the image to grayscale

# Applying threshold, here 0 is code for binary threshold method
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(imgray, 127, 255, 0)   

# arguments passed are image whose contours are to be found,
# second is contour retreival mode and third countour approximation method
# we need to find contours in this way only defining two variables
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)
print("Number of contours = " + str(len(contours)))
print(contours[0])

# for drawing contours on the image arguments passed are:-
# input image, where contours are stored, index of contour use -1 for drawing all contours
# color and thickness
cv2.drawContours(img, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)
cv2.drawContours(imgray, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)

# shows the image
cv2.imshow('Image', img)
cv2.imshow('Image GRAY', imgray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
