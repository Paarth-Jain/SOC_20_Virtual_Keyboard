# Canny Edge Detector
The Canny edge detector is used to detect multiple edges in an image (using multi-stage algorithm). Canny Edge detection gives more precise edges and reduces noise as compared to Laplacian or Sobel method. The algorithm is mainly gray-scale. 
The detection algorithm is of essentially 5 steps.

### 1. Noise reduction
   Since the mathematics involved behind the scene are mainly based on derivatives (cf. Step 2: Gradient calculation), edge detection results are highly sensitive to image noise. One way to get rid of the noise on the image, is by applying Gaussian blur to smooth it. To do so, image convolution technique is applied with a Gaussian Kernel (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 etc…). The kernel size depends on the expected blurring effect. Basically, the smallest the kernel, the less visible is the blur. In our example, we will use a 5 by 5 Gaussian kernel.

### 2. Gradient calculation
   The Gradient calculation step detects the edge intensity and direction by calculating the gradient of the image using edge detection operators. Edges correspond to a change of pixels’ intensity. To detect it, the easiest way is to apply filters that highlight this intensity change in both directions: horizontal (x) and vertical (y)
When the image is smoothed, the derivatives Ix and Iy w.r.t. x and y are calculated. It can be implemented by convolving I with Sobel kernels Kx and Ky, respectively.

   In the result some of the edges are thick and others are thin. Non-Max Suppression step will help us mitigate the thick ones.
Moreover, the gradient intensity level is between 0 and 255 which is not uniform. The edges on the final result should have the same intensity (i-e. white pixel = 255).

### 3. Non-max suppression
   The principle is simple: the algorithm goes through all the points on the gradient intensity matrix and finds the pixels with the maximum value in the edge directions. Let's take an example:
   ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1094/1*CWrXNSbe7s4qSFr5vylyvQ.png)
   The upper left corner red box present on the above image, represents an intensity pixel of the Gradient Intensity matrix being processed. The corresponding edge direction is represented by the orange arrow with an angle of -pi radians (+/-180 degrees).

   The edge direction is the orange dotted line (horizontal from left to right). The purpose of the algorithm is to check if the pixels on the same direction are more or less intense than the ones being processed. In the example above, the pixel (i, j) is being processed, and the pixels on the same direction are highlighted in blue (i, j-1) and (i, j+1). If one those two pixels are more intense than the one being processed, then only the more intense one is kept. Pixel (i, j-1) seems to be more intense, because it is white (value of 255). Hence, the intensity value of the current pixel (i, j) is set to 0. If there are no pixels in the edge direction having more intense values, then the value of the current pixel is kept.
   
### 4. Double Threshold
   The double threshold step aims at identifying 3 kinds of pixels: strong (high enough intensity to contribute to edge), weak (intensity value not high but not small enough to be considered irrelevant for edge detection), and non-relevant (non-relevant for the edge). Now you can see what the double thresholds holds for:
- High threshold is used to identify the strong pixels (intensity higher than the high threshold)
- Low threshold is used to identify the non-relevant pixels (intensity lower than the low threshold)
- All pixels having intensity between both thresholds are flagged as weak and the Hysteresis mechanism (next step) will help us identify the ones that could be considered as strong and the ones that are considered as non-relevant.

### 5. Edge tracking in hysteresis
   Based on the threshold results, the hysteresis consists of transforming weak pixels into strong ones, if and only if at least one of the pixels around the one being processed is a strong one, as described below:

There is a built-in function for Canny Edge Detection.
```Python
import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
img = cv2.imread('sports.jpg', 0) #read the image in gray-scale.
canny = cv2.Canny(img, 100, 200) 
#We need to provide two threshold values (argument 2 and 3) for hysteresis which is last step. To adjust threshold values add trackbar.
titles =['image', 'canny']
for i in range(2):
    plt.subplot(1,2,i+1)
    plt.imshow(images[i], 'gray')
    plt.title(titles[i])
    plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
```
