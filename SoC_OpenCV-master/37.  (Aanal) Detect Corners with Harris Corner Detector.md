# Detect Corners with Harris Corner Detector
Corners- Are the region in image with large intensity variation in all directions. Ths method includes three main steps:
STEP 1. It determines which windows (small image patches) produce very large variations in intensity when moved in both X and Y directions (i.e. gradients).
STEP 2. With each such window found, a score R is computed.
STEP 3. After applying a threshold to this score, important corners are selected & marked.

### Mathematical overview
STEP 1 :How do we determine windows which produce large variations?
Let a window (the center) be located at position (x,y). Let the intensity of the pixel at this location be I(x,y). If this window slightly shifts to a new location with displacement (u,v), the intensity of the pixel at this location will be I(x+u,y+v). Hence [I(x+u,y+v)-I(x,y)] will be the difference in intensities of the window shift. For a corner, this difference will be very high. Hence, we maximize this term by differentiating it with respect to the X and Y axes. Let w(x,y) be the weights of pixels over a window (Rectangular or a Gaussian) Then, E(u,v) is defined as :

Weighted sum multiplied by the intensity difference for all pixels in a window.
Now, computing E(u,v) by the above formula will be really, really slow. Hence, we use Taylor series expansion (only the 1rst order).

STEP 2: Now that we know how to find windows with large variations, how do we select the ones with suitable corners? It was estimated that the eigenvalues of the matrix can be used to do this. Thus, we calculate a score associated with each such window.

STEP 3: Depending on the value of R, the window is classified as consisting of flat, edge, or a corner.(Finally ðŸ˜›) A large value of R indicates a corner, a negative value indicates an edge. Also, to pick up the optimal corners, we can use non-maximum suppression.

```Python
import numpy as np
import cv2
img = cv2.imread("crossboard.jpg") 
cv2.imshow('image', img)
img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) #Built-in function for harris detector takes gray scale image (in float32) and grayscale also gives better results. 
img_gray = np.float32(img_gray)
dst = cv2.cornerHarris(img_gray, 2, 3, 0.04) #second parameter is block-size that is window-size is block_size square. third parameter is ksize that is the aperture size used for Sobel (used in step 1) and fourth is k which is harris free parameter in the equation. 
dst = cv2.dilate(dst, None) # dilate to get better results.

img[dst>0.01*dst.max()] = [0, 0, 255] #revert back to old image and mark the corners.
cv2.imshow('corner detection', img)

if cv2.waitKey(0) and 0xff==27:
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()```
