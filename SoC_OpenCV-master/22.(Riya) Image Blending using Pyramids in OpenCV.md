# Image Blending using Pyramids

One application of Pyramids is Image Blending. For example, in image stitching, you will need to stack two images together, but it may not look good due to discontinuities between images. In that case, image blending with Pyramids gives you seamless blending without leaving much data in the images. One classical example of this is the blending of two fruits, Orange and Apple.

![Apple and Orange image](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/orapple.jpg)

**There are five steps to achieve this:**

1. Load the two images of apple and orange.
2. Find the Gaussian Pyramids for apple and orange (in this particular example, number of levels is 6).
3. From Gaussian Pyramids, find their Laplacian Pyramids.
4. Now join the left half of apple and right half of orange in each levels of Laplacian Pyramids.
5. Finally from this joint image pyramids, reconstruct the original image.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
apple = cv2.imread('apple.jpg')                                                                 # read apple image
orange = cv2.imread('orange.jpg')                                                               # read orange image 
print(apple.shape)
print(orange.shape)
apple_orange = np.hstack((apple[:, :256], orange[:, 256:]))                                     # adding the first half of apple and the second half of orange 

                                                                                                # generate Gaussian pyramid for apple
