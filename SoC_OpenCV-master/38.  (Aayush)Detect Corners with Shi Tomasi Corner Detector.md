# SHI THOMSAI CORNER DETECTION

It is better method than Harris Corner detction method with giving us the option to choose number of corners to be detcted.

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv

#reading the image argument passed is the name of the image file to be read
img = cv.imread('pic1.png')

# Coverting image to grayscale as cv2.goodfeaturesToTrack takes grayscale image as an input.
# cv2.cvtColor can be used for converting from one color format to another like BGR2RGB, BGR2GRAY, BGR2HSV
gray = cv.cvtColor(img, cv.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Function which uses Shi Thomasi Corner Detction method
# It takes no. of arguments first the grayscale image, second number of corners you want to detect
# third quality which decides that it is corner or not (preferable 0.01)
# fourth minimum Euclidean distance between the detected corners
corners = cv.goodFeaturesToTrack(gray, 100, 0.01, 10)

# used to convert into 64 bit int
corners = np.int0(corners)

for i in corners:
     
    # ravel methods return contingous 1D array if it is 2D or 3D array
    x, y = i.ravel()        
    
    # To draw circle on the image
    # arguments passed are (source image, centre of circle in form of tuple, radius of circle, color in BGR format, thickness use negative to fill the circle)
    cv.circle(img, (x, y), 3, [255, 255, 0], -1)

# Shows the image to the user with first argument name of the window and second image source
cv.imshow('Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector', img)

if cv.waitKey(0) & 0xff == 27:
    cv.destroyAllWindows()
```
