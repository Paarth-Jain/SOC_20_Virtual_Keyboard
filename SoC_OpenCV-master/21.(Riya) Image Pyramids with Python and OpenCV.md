# Image Pyramids

**Pyramid**, or **pyramid representation**, is a type of multi-scale signal representation developed by the computer vision, image processing and signal processing communities, in which a signal or an image is subject to repeated **smoothing** and **subsampling**. Pyramid representation is a predecessor to **scale-space representation** and **multiresolution analysis**. With Image pyramids, we can create images with different resolutions.

**There are two kinds of image pyramids:**
### Gaussian Pyramid
In a Gaussian pyramid, subsequent images are weighted down using a Gaussian average (Gaussian blur) and scaled down. Each pixel containing a local average corresponds to a neighborhood pixel on a lower level of the pyramid. This technique is used especially in texture synthesis.
Gaussian pyramids use **cv.pyrDown()** to decrease the resolution of the image and **cv.pyrUp()** to increase the resolution of the image. 
### Laplacian Pyramid
A Laplacian pyramid is very similar to a Gaussian pyramid but saves the difference image of the blurred versions between each levels. Only the smallest level is not a difference image to enable reconstruction of the high resolution image using the difference images on higher levels. This technique can be used in image compression. A level in Laplacian Pyramid is formed by the difference between that level in **Gaussian Pyramid** and **Expanded version of its upper level in Gaussian Pyramid**.

**In this video, the gaussian and laplacian images of the above image are made.**

**The code for the above conversion is:**
```python

layer = img.copy()                                                              # making a copy of the image
gaussian_pyramid_list = [layer]                                                 # creating a list of the gaussian images of the given image 

for i in range(6):                                                              # creating a for loop to get all the gaussian transformed versions of the image
    layer = cv2.pyrDown(layer)                                                  # reducing the resolution of the image 
    gaussian_pyramid_list.append(layer)                                         # adding the created image to the list 
    cv2.imshow(str(i), layer)                                                   # command to show the reduced resolution version of the image 

layer = gaussian_pyramid_list[5]                                                # assigning the most reduced image to layer                                            
cv2.imshow('upper level Gaussian Pyramid', layer)                               # showing the most reduced image
laplacian_pyramid_list = [layer]                                                # creating a list for laplacian converted images  

for i in range(5, 0, -1):                                                       # creating an inverse for loop to get all the laplacian transformed versions of the image
    gaussian_expanded = cv2.pyrUp(gaussian_pyramid_list[i])                     # increasing the resolution of the image from the gaussian list which represents the expanded version
    laplacian = cv2.subtract(gaussian_pyramid_list[i-1], gaussian_expanded)     # subtracting a gaussian image having the same resolution from expanded version 
    cv2.imshow(str(i), laplacian)                                               # showing the laplacian image 

cv2.imshow("Original image", img)                                               # showing the original image

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
